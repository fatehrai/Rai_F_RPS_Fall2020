# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!

Pick your weapon and play againse the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose.

## Prerequisites 

All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) to play.

## Usage
Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your directory/download, and run the <code>game.py</code> file in a python 3 shell (Terminal on a mac / Linux, Windows command prompt).

## Rules
Same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers  
2. Rock Scissors cut paper  
3. Rock smashes scissors 

Choose your weapon wisely.

Built with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

Enjoy!
